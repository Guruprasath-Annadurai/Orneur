"""
Automated backup / disaster recovery — real gap this closes: SQLite/Postgres
had ZERO backup automation. One bad `rm`, disk failure, or corrupted write
loses the auth DB (users, audit log, everything) with no way back.

HONEST SCOPE:
  - This is a backup/prune tool, meant to be invoked by an external
    scheduler (cron, systemd timer, a scheduled CI job) — it does NOT
    schedule itself inside the running server process. That's deliberate:
    an in-process scheduler dies when the process dies/restarts/crashes,
    which is exactly when you most need backups to keep running. Standard
    ops practice is external scheduling; this tool is the thing THAT gets
    scheduled, not a scheduler itself.
  - SQLite backup uses sqlite3's own online backup API (Connection.backup()),
    not a raw file copy — a raw `cp` of a live SQLite file (especially in
    WAL mode, which orca/auth/db.py uses) can capture a half-written,
    inconsistent state. The backup API produces a consistent snapshot even
    while the source DB is being actively written to.
  - Postgres backup shells out to `pg_dump` — requires it installed on the
    machine running the backup (checked explicitly, raises a clear error
    if missing rather than silently producing an empty/broken dump).
  - Restore is documented and provided for SQLite (the common single-user
    case — copy the backup file back over the live DB). Postgres restore
    uses standard `pg_restore`/`psql < dump.sql` — documented, not
    reimplemented, since re-inventing Postgres's own restore tooling would
    be needless risk for something Postgres already does correctly.
