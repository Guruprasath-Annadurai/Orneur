"""
World Model / Knowledge Graph — per-session entity-relationship graph,
extracted from conversation via the LLM itself.

HONEST SCOPE — read before assuming this is a production knowledge graph:
  - This is a v1 foundation, not a distributed graph database. No entity
    resolution across sessions (the same "Alice" mentioned in two different
    sessions is two different graph nodes — there's no cross-session
    identity linking). No temporal fact versioning (if a fact changes, the
    old and new versions both sit in the graph as separate edges, not
    reconciled). No conflict detection between contradictory relationships.
  - Extraction is LLM-prompted triple extraction (subject, predicate,
    object) — heuristic quality bounded by the underlying model's
    reasoning, not a specialized NER/relation-extraction model. Same
    honesty posture as every other LLM-as-judge mechanism in this project
    (orca/train/redteam.py, orca/train/persona_eval.py): a floor, useful
    signal, not ground truth.
  - Scoped per-session, not global across all users — this is a deliberate
    privacy choice, not a limitation to fix later. A shared cross-user
    graph would need much more careful privacy/consent design (whose facts
    are these, who can see them, how does right-to-delete cascade through
    shared nodes) that this project's "local-first, session-scoped, user
    controls their own data" model doesn't currently support. Keeping it
    session-scoped means it plugs directly into the existing right-to-delete
    orchestration (orca/serve/account_delete.py) with the same
    clear()-on-delete pattern as DocStore and EpisodicMemory.
