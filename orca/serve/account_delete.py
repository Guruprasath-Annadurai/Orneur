"""
Right-to-delete — orchestrates a full account deletion across every store
that holds data tied to a user, not just the users table row.

Real architectural gap this closes: chat history, uploaded documents, and
memory files were keyed purely by session_id, with no persisted link back
to an owning user_id. orca/auth/store.py's user_sessions table (populated
by _get_session() whenever an authenticated request creates/touches a
session) is what makes "find everything this account touched" possible at
all — without it, this module could only delete the account row itself and
silently leave chat history/documents behind.

What this deletes:
  - The user's account row, API keys, usage records (orca.auth.store)
  - Every session this account is known to have touched:
      - Episodic memory file (orca/brain/memory.py's EpisodicMemory)
      - DocStore vectors + doc registry entries (orca/docs/store.py)
      - Knowledge graph entities/relationships (orca/brain/knowledge_graph.py)
      - Session title entry (orca/serve/api.py's session_titles.json)
      - Redis session state, if enabled (orca/serve/session_store.py)
  - Attempts to cancel any active Stripe subscription tied to this account
    (best-effort — logged, not fatal if it fails)

What this does NOT delete, stated plainly (same tension already documented
in legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md §5):
  - Historical audit log entries referencing this user_id. The audit log's
    entire value is being a tamper-evident record of what happened — a
    log you can retroactively edit isn't tamper-evident. Deleting entries
    would break the hash chain for every entry after it. The user_id in
    old audit entries becomes a dangling reference to a deleted account,
    not a live PII record — a policy/legal judgment call for the operator's
    jurisdiction, not something resolved automatically here.
  - Sessions the user touched WHILE UNAUTHENTICATED (anonymous chat before
    ever logging in) — those were never recorded in user_sessions because
    there was no user_id to record them against at the time. This is a
    real, current limitation, not swept under the rug.
