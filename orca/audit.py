"""
Audit log — hash-chained, tamper-evident event ledger.

Every entry embeds the SHA-256 hash of the previous entry (blockchain-style
Merkle chain, no consensus needed since it's single-writer). Tampering with
any historical row breaks the chain from that point forward — detectable by
recomputing hashes and comparing, no external trust anchor required.

Optional HMAC signing (ORCA_AUDIT_KEY env var) adds a second layer: even if
an attacker rewrites the entire chain consistently, they cannot forge valid
signatures without the key. Key should live outside the DB (env var, secret
manager, HSM) — never store it alongside the log it protects.

This is the trust foundation the enterprise governance layer sits on top of —
model cards, red-team reports, and "explain this answer" traces all reference
audit entries by id, and the whole point is a compliance officer or auditor
can verify none of it was altered after the fact.
